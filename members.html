                      My name is Natalie N. Soto López, I am currently in my last year of my bachelor's degree in Environmental Microbiology. 
                      This focuses on microorganisms associated with the environment and their possible effects on ecosystems, 
                      humans and even animals. My research interests include everything that can improve or help our environment. 
                      However, I am more inclined to research where I work and help with the conservation of endangered animals.

                      Concentration. I spent a year researching the Puerto Rican boa and its relationship with Ophidiomyces ophidiicola.
                      I never thought of working with snakes, but being part of this research I recognize the importance of studying them to provide more scientifically 
                      based information.

                      I am a student of the research focused on the isolation of environmental DNA of Ophidiomyces ophidiicola, 
                      being one of the pathogens that cause fungal diseases in snakes. Throughout the year that I have been part of this project, 
                      my interest in continuing research has grown, I have been able to learn and apply techniques that I did not know; above 
                      all I have learned how important it is to provide scientific information to help recognize the importance of each species, such as the Puerto Rican Boa, in the ecosystem.

                      My name is Patricia C. Chabrán Colón, I am a microbiology student with emphasis in the medical area. I find research to be an excellent way to expand knowledge beyond the theoretical, 
                      as it provides the opportunity to get more involved and gain new perspectives on topics of interest. Therefore, I consider it a super exciting experience that every student should have.

                      Hello! I am Jeiliany Rodríguez Pizarro and I am in my last year of my bachelor's degree in microbiology with emphasis in environmental microbiology. 
                      My research interests include the relationships between animals (reptiles, invertebrates and flying insects), plants and fungi and how these are reflected in the ecosystem. 
                      I have a particular interest in mutualistic symbioses and parasitic symbioses that require a broad knowledge of all organisms involved.

                      My name is Giovanni Colón, a student in Environmental Microbiology. I have had the opportunity to work as a volunteer in research related to the Puerto Rican parrot, 
                      Amazona vittata along with Dr. Brian Ramos. Also, in projects such as the Snake Fungal Disease or Survey of Ophidiomycosis in Endemic Boas of Puerto Rico, Chilabothrus inornatus 
                      along with Prof. Eneilis Mulero. Likewise, I had the opportunity to participate from beginning to end with my fellow researchers in the parasitological study of feces in the exotic species Boa constrictor.  
                      Currently, I aspire to continue my studies in medicine.

                      Greetings dear colleagues, my name is Jaraileen Marrero Méndez, and I am a graduate student at the University of Puerto Rico Arecibo campus. I have developed in the field of veterinary medicine after 
                      completing my studies in environmental microbiology. During my time as a student, I carried out multiple laboratory projects that planted in me a high interest in scientific research. This degree has 
                      opened the doors to different branches of science where I plan to continue my studies.

                       of our planet. I participated in research in order to discover on field trips if my passion for the environment could be further developed and to be able to contribute to the scientific community. 
                       My main interests were to further develop my skills in the field, as well as to complement it with laboratory work.

                    PI of the PR Surveillance Program for Pathogenic Fungi of Reptiles
                    
                    My line of work focuses on environmental mycology, where the emphasis has been on the study of fungi associated with animals. My previous work includes studies on the diversity of fungi associated with leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) nests in Puerto Rico and the isolation and characterization of fungi associated with marine sponges. These areas are relevant for monitoring emerging pathogenic organisms that may affect protected species. I am also the Co-PI for the Pilot Study for the Isolation and Molecular Characterization of Ophidiomyces ophidiicola from Cave Habitats in Puerto Rico.

                    Recent research efforts include fungal disease surveillance in leatherback sea turtles and freshwater turtles of the genus Trachemys. 

                    I teach courses in Environmental Mycology, Molecular Biology, Biotechnology, and Microbiology. Also, I direct undergraduate student research in the area of Environmental Mycology.
